        <P>The Millet Kitchen is aimed towards those who seek to maintain a healthy lifestyle but are lost without a place to start. While millets have been in the Indian kitchen for thousands of years, it is only recently that they are getting the attention they deserve. This book is a love letter to the modern cooking enthusiast who wants to elevate their cooking with millets but not comprising for flavor.
