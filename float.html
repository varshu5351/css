        <p>Hon’ble Minister for Municipal Administration and Urban Development, Industry & Commerce, Information Technology, Government of Telangana

            The inclination towards public life was always there for KTR as he grew watching his father from close quarters. However, KTR decided that politics would be his life’s calling as he was strongly influenced by a quotation from his University days. KTR made his political debut by winning from Sircilla Assembly Constituency in 2009. He was re-elected from the same constituency in 2014, in the first elections to Telangana Assembly, and assumed the charge of Cabinet Minister. KTR now holds the portfolios of IT, Industries & Commerce, MA&UD and NRI Affairs. In the brief span of three years, KTR has already left an indelible imprint on the growth path that the State of Telangana has embarked on. It’s only the beginning.
            
            Kalvakuntla Taraka Rama Rao, popularly known as KTR, is a Cabinet Minister in the Government of Telangana, the 29th State of India. He is the Member of the Legislative Assembly from Sircilla Constituency since 2009.
            
            Born in Siddipet on 24 July, 1976, KTR is the son of K Chandrashekar Rao, the first Chief Minister of Telangana. He grew up in a politically active family and completed his schooling from St. George’s Grammar School, Hyderabad before going to Nizam College, Hyderabad. He studied M.Sc. in Biotechnology from University of Pune and also holds an MBA degree in Marketing and E-Commerce from City University of New York, NY.
            
            After finishing his MBA, KTR worked in USA between 2001-06. But his interest in the prevailing socio-economic condition in the region brought him back to where his heart belongs – politics. He joined Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) and worked under the leadership of his father to bring Statehood to the region of Telangana. During this period, he travelled the length and breadth of the State and interacted with people to understand their problems and aspirations, which later helped in shaping his political career. KTR made his political entry in 2009 Assembly elections. He assumed the charge of a cabinet minister in the first Government of Telangana in June 2014.
